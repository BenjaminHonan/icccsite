###Location

{{ map }}

From the parking by Lost Johns', walk down the road (away from the farm). Notts 1 is in the field beyond the one Lost Johns' is in. It is also in the same field as Notts 2. It's possible to recognise based on the rocky outcrops quite close to road. Once in the field walk up the hill quite a long way until you get to a big shakehoke with Notts 1 in it (look at some photos to recognise it but its a big big hole).
