### Washing Machines

The new Korean washing machines are shiny and musical.
They have a range of settings, but it's almost always best to program them yourself.

**Rinse** - go all out and add the highest level of rinse (5) to every wash.
Because we can't wash at a high temperature, this is a good way to get rid of dirt.

**Ropes** - flake tightly + add lots of stopper locks to the head. Place
around drum of washing machine + wash on 20 (off-cold) with **no
detergent** and **no spin cycle**. Don't overstuff as friction against the glass plate while
spinning can melt ropes! Pad with neoprene if the drum is really empty -
stops the spin cycle from being too vibronic, and reduces chance of
uncoiling + tangling.

**Furries** - try and have a 100% polyester wash, as it will spin dry
itself almost completely. Use synthetic at 30, with a spin at 800. 
Use detergent - shampoo is a good substitute if we're out of
laundry stuff.
If you add even a bit of cotton / neoprene everything comes out more damp. 
You can tumble dry furries, but not too hot --- use a timed dry, 1 hour at a low temperature. 

**Wetsocks** - Usually put in with misc bits of muddied gear, such as footloops + cowstails / harnesses / etc. 
If the cowstails are suitably padded with neoprene stuff in the drum, you don't
need to remove the carabiners. Wash as delicates, 20 C (off-cold), no spin cycle.
**Don't use detergent**. Dry in the brothel.

**Wetsuits** - **do not wash wetsuits**. Instead hose them down and leave them to drip dry in stores, or in the brothel.

**The brothel**. This big white fridge looking thing opposite the washing machine has Dan's brothel written on it.
We don't know why, but it's a good name. It has long tubes that pipe out hot air, perfect for drying wetsocks.
Thread a wetsock over a pipe, put the heat dial to pointing downwards (not the hottest setting) and the time to 4 hours. Add time as necessary. Also good for wetsuits.
