A guide for future committee members organising trips; by Jarv April
2007. Last Update Feb 2013 by Rhys.





As long as possible in Advance
------------------------------

Trips need Drivers. Without enough people to drive the minibus, nothing
will happen. Once you have drivers, or the expectation of drivers, start
a list collecting names. **12** is the maximum number in a 15 seater
minibus, before having to resort to such faff as the roof rack (though
this is not too much extra effort).





-   Trips to the Wales and Mendips involve about 4hrs drive, and are
    good for non-SRT trips.
-   Trips to Yorkshire and Derbyshire involve about 6 and 5hrs drive
    respectively, and are better for SRT trips.

A trip to Mendips / Wales is possible with just one driver, wheras a
solo driving trip to Yorkshire would be extremely unpleasent. Of course,
you ideally want many more - as the driver could become ill over the
weekend.





The Term Before
---------------

Book the Minibus. Bookings are actually only processed 2 weeks in
advance, but sit in some weird queue if you submit them earlier.

For a weekend trip, our typical times are from 17:00 on Friday to 23:59
on Sunday.

**Book a hut** Choose a hut, and book it. The various region club's
websites are are pretty good now-a-days. The wardens are usually pretty
bad at emails, so phoning is the way forward.

Our general hut preference is as follows:

-   **Yorkshire** Greenclose (NPC) for general caving, BPF (RRCPC) if
    one intends to do Saturday trips in Easeghyll
-   **Derbyshire** Orpheus, followed by Chapel (TSG)
-   **Wales** WSG for general caving, SWCC if long Saturday trips in OFD
-   **Mendips** Belfry (BEC) for party atmosphere, SMCC for its fine
    collection of spoons





2 weeks in advance
------------------

Everything starts getting more real here. The minibus booking should
have been processed, and the person making the booking should have
received a confirmation email. CHECK THOSE DATES! Don't end up with a
minibus supposedly returning at 11:59am on Sunday, or one that you can
only pick up at 6am on Saturday!





Tuesday before
--------------

This is crunch time! Make sure that everyone releases that they're
coming at this point; that everything is booked & that all is go! Try to
get as many people as possible to pack on this Tuesday. It makes Friday
a lot less hectic.





The Fateful Friday
------------------

You need to:

-   Pick up keys from SAC; probably filling in some forms at the time.
    They'll tell you what and where
-   Submit an 'Activity Registration' on eActivities. This requires a
    list of people going on the trip.
-   Pick up any hut keys if they've been posted down. Or make sure you
    have any magic pin codes /etc. , and **know where the hut is**.
-   Pick up the minibus (you'll need a driver). Make sure they sign the
    hire form, and do all the magic checks. Its acceptable to drive over
    to outside stores before doing \_all\_ the checks - but at least
    make sure it has 4 wheels + etc. If the bus is severely screwed,
    there should be a magic yellow form on the driver seat. Don't just
    sit on it & driver off...
-   Sort out the freshers / novices. Someone should be down at stores to
    open up, make sure everyone packs everything necessary & etc.
-   **Shopping**. This is a dark art. Its impossible to give a 'typical'
    shop list as tastes change, offers come and go - and strangest of
    all, caver's consumption of various foods is extremely seasonal. For
    instance, very little cheese is consumed in summer. More than ≈Å5 per
    person and you're useless. Don't forget to check what was left over
    from the last weekends, and also to occasionally buy the
    non-perishables (spices, pepper, etc.)

Never the less, here's an attempt at a 'things to remember'.

-   DON'T FORGET THE FLIPPING **MAP**! Its been annotated with locations
    of most huts and caves, and works with no electricity.
