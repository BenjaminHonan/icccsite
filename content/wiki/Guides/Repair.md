Oversuits

*By Jarvist*

Intending for UK Caving style Warmbac (Cordura fabric) / Meander/TSA
(PVC) oversuits.





-   Wash the oversuit! Glue will not stick to dirty / dusty fabric, and
    sewing through grit embedded in fabric is almost impossible Either
    washing machine or hosepipe + scrub the oversuit. Fabric can be
    further rubbed with alcohol to degrease.




-   Sew the tear, gathering together the material if necessary Use fully
    Nylon thread so it doesn’t rot (Gutermann Top Stitch Thread is the
    best I’ve tried), a strong leather needle and ideally a sailor’s
    palm to protect your hands




-   Smear 1-part glue over the stitching and repair. For Fabric
    oversuits, ideally use Aquasure or Black Witch. For Meanders use a
    flexible PVC glue.




-   For PVC oversuits, now cut a patch to cover the sewn repair to about
    +1cm all around. Not too big, and make sure the edges are cut
    smoothly (rounded corner) so it can’t lift off Placing patch on suit
    and drawing round outline with ballpoint pen makes glue
    placement easier.




-   Stretch out the oversuit on a baseboard / put a coaster / mess tin
    within the oversuit to press against Newspaper is good for covering
    the repair to prevent it sticking to boards, etc. Make sure to put
    some paper inside legs/arms to prevent them being glued closed.
-   Smear glue over the repair (on the oversuit) you want a smooth thin
    layer, not globs




-   For large patches and quick-gripping glue, having alignment marks on
    patch and suit can help – when drawing the outline, drawing a couple
    of crosses which cross the suit/patch boundary can make initial
    placement easier.




-   Apply patch + compress, leave overnight You can consider using
    tissue / toilet / news paper layered on the patch so that the
    pressure is applied in the correct way. You can use dive lead, wood
    clamps or even park a vehicle on top of the repair. For repairs next
    to thick or non-flat suit areas (pockets, crotch, etc) relatively
    thick patch-sized padding might be needed to ensure pressure applied
    all goes on to the patch.
