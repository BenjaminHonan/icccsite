Theory, Background & Motivation

*It's never going to work!*





2010 Implementation
-------------------

### DC Pump

The pump we found is made by the Dongguan Zhonglong Motor & Electric
Company: <http://www.zhonglongmotor.com/english/chanpinok.asp?PicID=6>

It's a tiny 24V DC Water Pump, spec'd at 420ml/s to 11m head height
running off 24V DC, pulling over 60W.

The construction is really quite nice - four nuts + bolts hold the pump
assembly together, which is made out of 3 injection moulded pieces of
plastic. The volute chamber and inlet/outlet hoses form the first bit of
plastic which has a o-ring seal.

≈Å30, delivered, from China.





### Lay flat Discharge Hose

This stuff appears to be perfect for lightweight hydro - coiling flat
for transport yet still standing an atmosphere or two. This appears to
have quite large use on building sites + farms as pump discharge hose
when training ponds. Search eBay using the above magic words to find it
in diameters from 20-50mm, cut to the metre.
