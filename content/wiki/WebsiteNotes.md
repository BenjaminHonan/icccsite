WebsiteNotes 
============





**Website Logs**

Logs are generated using 'webalizer', there is a script in the /logs
directory when you SSH in. They have to be generated every &lt;14days
apart otherwise info gets lost. If this screws up, a unix kiddie should
be able to fix it by trawling through all the Gzip'd apache files.

**Average Display Size**

We optimise for a minimum screenwidth of 1024x768. The site is still
perfectly useable with a lower resolution, just you have to scroll left
and right to see the left-column nav bar and the full reports (due to
the static size of the pictures). As such the group photos photo is
usually 700pixels wide.
