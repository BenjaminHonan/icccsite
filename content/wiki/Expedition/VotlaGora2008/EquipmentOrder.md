And a Bolting kit in Hand,

Don't Fence me in.

Drill
-----

-   We'd want a drill, a number of battery packs (+ the option of
    running directly off 12V lead-acid gel cells), a suitable collection
    of bits and a stash of disturbing Rawl bolts for danger.

Bolts: 8mm (also for Hilti), 6mm (danger rawl!), Spit size (12mm? 13mm?)
