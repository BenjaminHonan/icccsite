"We are having an ongoing discussion on the Norwegian caving forum about
bolt strength (what is and isn't safe). The standard bolt in Norway
seems to be externally threaded 10mm bolts. These are used together with
the petzl coeur 10mm stainless hangers. These bolts are quite expensive
so i am interested in the cheaper hilti HKD style bolts with a flange to
stop them going into a slightly too deep hole. These are available both
in galvanised and stainless models. The stainless model is about 4-5
times the price of the galvanised ones but are still cheaper (i think)
than the externally threaded sort which are also available in both
stainless and galvanised versions and different lengths." From ukcaving
