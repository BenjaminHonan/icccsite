### Dirty Old Rhyme, from Newsletter 18 Winter 1993

``` 
Dirty Old Rhyme
-> To the tune of "Dirty Old Town"

I met my pals down the caving stores
Drove up north in a clapped out van
At the Watford Gap stopped and Bought a mag
Dirty old mag, dirty old mag

We drove from there to the NPC
Had a smoke and a cup of tea
laid our heads on the filthy beds
Dirty old beds, dirty old beds.

Woke on the morn with a stonking horn
ate my beans, bacon and sweatcorn
dropped a log in the stinking bog
Dirty old bog, dirty old bog.

Then planned our day from a stained survey
packed our ropes in the tackle bags
Hurled abuse at the clubs old lags
Dirty old lags, dirty old lags.

Drove to the cave, it was 4 o'clock
A little late but who gave a fuck
We emptied our bags and strewn around our legs, was
Dirty old kegs, dirty old kegs.

Sighted the hole in the suns last ray
Rigged it fast without delay
Had a dump at the terminal sump
Dirty old sump, dirty old sump.

We were nearly out when we heard a shout
went back to see who it could be
at the final pitch was some poor bitch
Dirty old bitch, dirty old bitch.

We finally got changed and headed to the Pub
Drank some beer and ate some grub
Eyed the dames during silly games
Dirty old games, dirty old games.

Time to go home on a Sunday night
Packed the van had a final shite
So till the next time when we sing this rhyme
Dirty old rhyme, dirty old rhyme.
Dirty old rhyme, dirty old rhyme.

### Ten Little Cavers, from Newsletter 17, Spring 1993

``` 
Ten little cavers,
Went off to do a mine.
One found a hidden shaft,
And then there were nine.

Nine little cavers,
Found Lancaster in spate.
One tried the water's depth,
And then there were eight.

Eight little cavers,
Exploring down in Devon.
One got locked inside a cave,
And then there were seven.

Seven little cavers,
Clearing chokes with picks.
One caught a falling rock,
And then there were six.

Six little cavers,
Learning how to dive.
One stayed down too long,
And then there were five.

Five little cavers,
On a calcite floor.
One sat on the weakest part,
And then there were four.

Four little cavers,
Abseiling down G.G.
One forgot his cowstails,
And then there were three.

Three little cavers,
Splashing through Ffynnon Ddu.
One slipped in the streamway,
And then there were two.

Two little cavers,
Prospecting in the sun.
One found a brand new pitch.
And then there was one.

One worried caver,
Took up dancing instead:
Tripped on a trailing bootlace
And now he too is dead.

### Puff, the magic dragon

An absolute classic from the bivi on the 2005-07 expos. We had it in
Hungarian for 2008 courtesy of Gergely.





``` 
Puff, the magic dragon lived by the sea
And frolicked in the autumn mist in a land called honah lee,
Little jackie paper loved that rascal puff,
And brought him strings and sealing wax and other fancy stuff. oh

Puff, the magic dragon lived by the sea
And frolicked in the autumn mist in a land called honah lee,
Puff, the magic dragon lived by the sea
And frolicked in the autumn mist in a land called honah lee.

Together they would travel on a boat with billowed sail
Jackie kept a lookout perched on puffs gigantic tail,
Noble kings and princes would bow wheneer they came,
Pirate ships would lower their flag when puff roared out his name. oh!

Puff, the magic dragon lived by the sea
And frolicked in the autumn mist in a land called honah lee,
Puff, the magic dragon lived by the sea
And frolicked in the autumn mist in a land called honah lee.

A dragon lives forever but not so little boys
Painted wings and giant rings make way for other toys.
One grey night it happened, jackie paper came no more
And puff that mighty dragon, he ceased his fearless roar.

His head was bent in sorrow, green scales fell like rain,
Puff no longer went to play along the cherry lane.
Without his life-long friend, puff could not be brave,
So puff that mighty dragon sadly slipped into his cave. oh!

Puff, the magic dragon lived by the sea
And frolicked in the autumn mist in a land called honah lee,
Puff, the magic dragon lived by the sea
And frolicked in the autumn mist in a land called honah lee.
