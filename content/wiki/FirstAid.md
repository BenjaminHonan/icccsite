FirstAid 
========





<http://www.oucc.org.uk/procs/proc12/medic.htm> - OUCC Expo First Aid
short guide from Proc 12 \~1986

The main concept of our idea for caving First Aid for 2007 revolves
around the idea of a two-tier deployment. The club will maintain 4 small
first-aid kits for the leaders to carry in their SRT sacs, and a bright
yellow Tacklesac (with two 6.4L Daren drums inside) will be kept in the
minibus for use as 'second aid'.





------------------------------------------------------------------------

Therefore: the leader kits are to:

-   Treat minor incidences, and patch-up the casualty to enable a
    self-rescue
-   Stabilise the casualty, most particularly from hypothermia, while
    awaiting a stronger rescue

The van-kit is to:

-   Treat intermediate-level events fully, provide self-rescue
    capabilities for a sufficiently strong group
-   Stabilise the casualty after a serious incidence, and prepare the
    way for Cave Rescue Organisations





------------------------------------------------------------------------

Typical use envisaged is something like this:





-   Minor self rescue: Caver Josephine abseils too fast, lands on
    forearm & displays an open wound and possible fracture. Fully
    conscious and capable.
    -   Treatment: Leader-kit provides zinc-oxide tape, triangular
        bandage, safety pins to secure and Ibuprofan
        as anti-inflammatory. Escorted out cave.

    

    

-   Intermediate Self-Rescue: Caver Bruno slips and falls a short
    distance, landing awkwardly. Foot is extremely painful and will not
    take weight.
    -   Treatment: Bruno is assisted to somewhere nearby, safe from
        flooding + relatively warm. Foot is left in welly. Camp is made
        with candles / lighters, survival bags in helmets and
        space-blankets in rescue kits. Most experienced member of party
        exits cave and retrieves Rescue tackle sac, leaving note for
        other cavers in minibus. Leader / another leader returns to
        casualty and uses Sam-Splints to immobilize ankle. Bruno is
        assisted on SRT exit, such as by top-roping from pitch-hang bolt
        with spare rope + pulley-jammer.

    

    

-   Major Incident: Caver Marjorie slips and falls a
    considerable distance. Presents an open fracture on leg and
    painful hip.
    -   Treatment: Casualty moved shortest distance to safe place and
        otherwise as above. Leader exits and calls Cave Rescue, allowing
        himself to be coordinated by the CRO leader, but most probably
        returning to the cave with the rescue kit. The Blizzard survival
        bag is used to make a more effective camp; ancillary issues are
        dealt with and preparations made for stretchering-out.

The leader-kits DO NOT contain: Food, backup lighting, clothing, knives
or whistles. These should all be separately carried by cavers on trips.

-   Triangular Bandage
-   Space Blanket

**&gt;50% of available space is taken up by above**





-   Zinc Oxide Tape
-   Two Tea-lights
-   Watch-Strap / Button Compass (Gelert)
-   Waterproof paper
-   Pencil Stub
-   Piezo Lighter (clicky type, not flint roller)

    -   Ibuprofan 400mg
    -   Paracetemol 500mg
    -   ??? More exciting drugs?





Suggestions (see Yahoogroups Jan 2005)
--------------------------------------

-   Balaclava. A life saver.
-   A Plastic bag & Bog paper
-   Nylon pulley
-   Safety Pins
    

    

-   -A knife-.
-   Spare Light
-   A WATCH -- This is so basic, but the cause of so many callouts.
-   \*Emergency\* Mars bar.





### **Rescue** Tackle Sac

-   First-Aid Daren Drum
    -   Based around mountain-leader / expo UG-camp first-aid kit
    -   + exciting drugs

    

    

-   Rescue / Anti-hypothermia / Food / Sam Splint
    -   Blizzard three-layer survival bag (equiv. to a 2/3 season
        sleeping bag; people have slept in Daren in them)
    -   Jammer-pulleys on oval krabs
    -   Chocolate bars
    -   Sam Splints sufficient to immobilize a foot / arm

Fundamentally we can't put too much stuff in here: it needs to be light
enough to be EASILY taken down to the casualty by a potentially TIRED
leader.
