# First Aid

## Personal First Aid

The club has eight small first aid kits, in sealed waterproof beakers.
Each kit is meant to provide minimal material for first aid underground.
The kits are by necessity quite compact, and are not a replacement for the full first aid kit in the rescue bag.

Each team should have at least one (preferably two) first aid kits.
### Each kit contains:
- 1 triangular bandage
- 1 roll of vetrap/vet wrap
- 3 safety pins
- One sterile dressing
- 2 paracetamol
- 2 ibuprofen

Spares of these are kept in the Spare First Aid drawer in stores, or in a white cardboard box on the shelves in expo stores.

The purpose of each item is as follows (the list is not exhaustive!):
- One triangular bandage: sling, splinting, eyepatch, tourniquet (careful!)
- One roll of vetrap/vet wrap: self adhesive (doesn't stick to skin or anything else, just itself), so good for holding dressing in placwe
- 3 safety pins: sling, holding tongue, removing splinters
- One sterile dressing: covering a wound that has stopped bleeding and ahs been rinsed, part of an eye patch
- 2 paracetamol: general pain relief (analgesic). Probably most useful for headaches
- 2 ibuprofen: pain relief and also actively reduces swelling. Absolute go to for bumps, bruises, sprains etc.

Note: There is a belief in the first aid community in the UK that you should not give or offer someone drugs such as ibuprofen and paracetamol, 
but instead allow the patient to take them. This statement is included for completeness.

### Survival bags
Almost everyone who gets injured in a cave also gets cold, and the people with them will also get cold.
Every helmet should contain a survivial bag, a thin polythene bag large enough for one person, bought from Caving Supplies.
Cut off one corner, take off your helmet, climb inside the bag, replace the helmet over the bag to secure it, and feel the toasty warmth envelop you.
