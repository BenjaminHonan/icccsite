Tera in GW.

### B.Ogborne

-   Size 2m
-   Scariness 9 (purely because you worry that you may never get off the
    top of it)
-   Impressiveness 0
-   Engineering 0
-   Rigging 0





Lost City Traverse (from hotline over the top of M16 pitch series into Lost City...)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Shed

-   Size: 50m+
-   Scarinesss 7
-   Impressiveness 8
-   Engineering 2 (Really not enough)
-   Rigging 3 (Not sure a bolt simply wedged between two rocks counts?)

### Shed

-   Size 35m
-   Scariness 9 (Really the water was VERY cold and you could not get
    out of it)
-   Impressiveness 4
-   Engineering 1 (A lift was really needed...)
-   Rigging 8 (Lots of unesissarily tight rebalys under waterfalls)

Size Titan: 8 Plopzilla: 9 (bigger volume!) Gladiators: 10 (bottomless!)
Dihedral: 7

Scaryness (add +1 if rigging/derigging, and +1 if descending, +1 for
9mm, knot passes, Rik's rigging etc etc) Titan: 6 Plopzilla: 9
Gladiators: 9 Dihedral: 7 (+1 in daylight)

Impressiveness: Titan: 4 (too dark) Plopzilla: 6 (helictites are better
than curtains) Gladiators: 5 Dihedral: 10 (wow!)

Engineering: Titan: 10 (50m through solid rock!!) Plopzilla: 2 (Rik
hitting squeeze with bolting hammer...) Gladiators: 9 (steel traverse)
Dihedral: 2 (+6 for Winch meet)

Rigging: Titan: 10 (perfect hangs, massive bolts) Plopzilla: 2
(headfirst squeeze out onto pitch followed by Rik's 5 minute spits...)
Gladiators: 9 (steel traverse) Dihedral: 6 (P-hangers)
