**Objective**

Get rid of your cards.

**Ranks**

Suits don't matter. Aces high. Use two decks if people&gt;7. Doesn't
matter if people start with diff. number of cards.

**Rules**

First person starts with i.e. two 7s. Following person has to either
pass, or play a higher set i.e. two Jacks. After a full round of
passing, played cards are turned over and person to left starts play
again. Do not have to play, can pass then play etc.

**P&A**

First person to get rid of cards is President, second is Vice President.
Last two are Vice Arsehole and Arsehole.

On next round, Arsehole gives two highest ranking cards to Pres, Pres
gives two worst (his choice) to arsehole. Same for vice pres + vice
arse, except one card.

**Cheating**

Strongly encouraged. In particular, hiding other cards below the correct
top card (i.e. putting down 3,4,5,5 instead of 5,5,5,5) works quite
well.
