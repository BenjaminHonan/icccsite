## 2015-04-10 - Ed's Cellar 

( This was transcribed by JMF at 23:40 BST, so 10:40 NZ time tomorrow 2015-04-11, 
from a fairly broken GSM phone call around the
world (which soon got dropped), and then a Google chat from Jack's Android phone! 
Any errors or omissions are almostly certainly lost in circumnavigation. )

The weather is still really poor, the rest have gone caving... I thought I'd
give you a ring.

We are camping near the carpark for
Hardwood hole, a cave with an impressive 200 m entrance pitch about 40 minutes
walk away, a very popular tourist spot as it is a huge open pitch. So loads of
hikers turn up in battered vehicles.

The carpark has drop toilets and taps for water (though we purify it). 

We are pushing leads in Ed's Cellar in Takaka hill, a highly vertical (SRT)
cave.
Last surveyed 1962, we've got a going lead at the bottom of some tight pitches
with flowstone blocking a rift.

So Rhys, Chris and Tanguy have gone to push it today. 
With James, Cecilia and Alex resurveying behind them as the 1962 survey left no
PSS to branch off.

Kiwis favour naturals and terrifying free climbs but we bolted some stuff. One
lovely 30 m pitch free hang, then some tighter ones over loose rock faces. The
new pitch is 20 m.

Tanguy and I drew up the survey by hand last night, we had surveyed 160m of
passage to a depth of 80m.

Beautiful dark marble with calcite infilled fractures, very loose rock.
And razor sharp!

Glorious sunshine yesterday dried everything out and we have three tarps to
make a great bivi.
Thick mist today, but not heavy rain.

We have spotted a break in the weather early next week and are consulting with
Kieran as to whether we can fly up Mt Owen then. If not, we'll probably stay in
the present vicinity, there's loads of new exploration potential.

Right, we should get back to camp to make sure everything goes smoothly. If you
can turn any of this into an update for the website that'd be swell.

##2015-04-08 - Ed's Cellar

Yesterday we got extremely wet and failed to find a cave. Full of hope and
optimism, we set out to find Ed's cellar, which we had been recommended by
Kieran. After 11 km of rally style driving, we finally arrived at the car park,
the underside of our car well scoured. It was pissing it down.

A fairy tale forest lured us in, enchanting mists, near luminescent moss and
dappled pools guided us down the Sylvain path. At least, this is what Rhys
saw. Cecilia trudged inwards, mindful only of the rain and the weight of the
tackle sack Rhys had kindly given her to lug. Our directions were excellent and
we completely failed to follow them, arriving at a different and far more
impressive cave, Hardwood's Hole, which we were unequipped to descend, given
that the entrance pitch is 200 m deep.

Whilst we struggled to absorb the scale of the pit, our clothes easily absorbed
the scale of the rainfall. Sodden and a little glum, we trudged back to the
cars, squeezing in for a bumpy ride back to the hut.

In the afternoon we looked for caves near the NSG hut and found several
interesting leads, including Burnt tree, Danger Zone and Lairy. The sun came
out and we dried off a little, bashing across thrusting karst outcrops of black
marble, sharp as knives and brittle as bone. Deep in the forest below, black
mould coated trees and the rain clung to the branches, waiting to soak the
unwary.

Today, Rhys, Oli and Chris went to find Ed's Cellar, buoyed by the discovery of
a map attached to the email Kieran sent us showing exactly where to find the
cave. Crudely transcribed map in hand, we succeeded in locating the cave,
significantly moister, and with many embedded thorns. The cave was immediately
unappealing - a dank muddy hole leads to a spider strewn tube, at the bottom of
which was a 30 m pitch.

With some inventive rigging, we were down and negotiated several terrifying
climbs and, um, that was it really. We found the pushing front but ran out of
time after placing a couple of bolts. We left the cave rigged for the next day
and returned to the hut.

The rest of the cavers spent the day looking more closely at the leads
generated yesterday. Burnt Tree proved to be a 3m deep pit, Danger Zone ended
in an unfeasibly tight crawl and the new Sneaky Shaft was found to be about
4 m deep by some inventive boulder dropping and free climbing.

We rigged a cave near the road marked with Red Tape from two trees and
a massive deviation from a fallen log. The shaft was wide and muddy, and Tanguy
kicked off boulders as he went. He placed two bolts, and invited me down to rig
a deviation below. About 40 m down I smelt an odd metallic smell that made me
concerned about air quality. After a quick survey with my light to confirm the
cave probably ended in a muddy boulder choke, I ascended and derigged.

Tomorrow we will head to Canaan Downs to set up a base camp for exploring the
region for caves.

##2015-04-06 - Rain Day

New Zealand caving is completely different to UK caving: we are staying in
a hut, the roads to the caves are awful and the food is mostly lentils. Due to
horrific weather, we have been unable to convince a helicopter pilot to risk
his life and career by flying us and our heavy, heavy equipment up the
mountain. Whilst we wait for this apocalyptic storm to pass, we cower in the
Nelson Speleological Group's extremely cute hut in Takaka hill.

The effects of jet lag are severe. Our mental faculties are not what they once
were. Tanguy descends often into fits of giggling, and of course caves.

Yesterday we went to the beach, and met with some NZ cavers that gave us loads
of good advice, and camped at a little campground in a secluded valley. Today
we spent an hour and a half buying all the food and supplies for the
expedition, arriving at the supermarket at 0700 and ending up with literally
all the peanuts, raisins and lentils in the store. We then drove to Takaka
Hill.

Kieran showed us a cave about 100m from the hut. This was excellent as when we
got to the bottom we could send Alex back for cookies and water. The cave was
quite loose, but very pretty and felt unexplored. Rhys chickened out of a grim
crawl in the final lead that we tried to push.

Tomorrow we will get very wet and try to get a tire repaired that has been left
too long thanks to Jesus and Easter. Please someone stop James from writing
a log book entry again.

The effects of jet lag are severe.
