Summary: I spent Sunday evening modifying a Makita drill to use an external battery. After a bit of experimental soldering, it seems to be working fine.

We have one Makita rotary hammer drill in the club already, but for this expedition we wanted another so we could have two teams bolting at the same time. Jarv already described the LiPo batteries in a [previous post](https://union.ic.ac.uk/rcc/caving/newzealand/articles/2015-03-12-drills.html), and he also an excellent [blog post](https://migovec.wordpress.com/2011/07/06/makita-bhr162/) detailing modifying Makita drills with long leads for external batteries. We bought a new drill off eBay for £99 (all the cost is in the batteries, so 'naked' drills are quite cheap). Having nothing better to do with my Sunday evening, I decided to crack it open and poke around inside.

###Disassembling the Drill
{"Under the two black plastic caps is this little copper cap holding the carbon brushes in" left}("IMG_20150315_190031.jpg") First, I pulled out the carbon brushes. There are two, hiding under two layers of black plastic caps that you can pry out with a flat head screwdriver. {"The carbon brushes are on little springs and like to fly out at random" right}("IMG_20150315_190032.jpg") Once they are out of the way and stored in a little pot for later, I whipped off the four long screws that hold the motor and drill chuck in place. {"The front part of the drill is held in with four long screws" left}("IMG_20150315_190012.jpg") With a little bit of force you can pull this section out -  the large permanent magnet in the back section puts up a bit of a fight. Then I removed the seven short screws that hold the two halves of the back section together, revealing all the wonderful electronics inside.  {"Lots of wires inside the drill, many of which I have no idea wha they do" right}("IMG_20150315_190658.jpg").
