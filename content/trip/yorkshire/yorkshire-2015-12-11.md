## Friday

Another weekend, another quick swing by Leamington Spa to collect Alex, who'd be doing some of the driving. Having accidentally entered the train station during some brief rush hour, Jarv managed to escape by backing out onto a main road, before doing a U-turn to take us towards Morrisons. Despite Jarv's efforts to sabotage my thrifty food budget with knock off jaffa cakes, mince pies and double cream, the total came to around £5 a person, the best I've ever seen. We also discovered Biere Continentale, which at 2.8% makes even our standard Bier D'or look extravagant. Okay, enough about Morrisons.

Morrisons was amazing. The big yellow glow so near the train station, our promised land of cut price delights, shelves stacked with all a hungry caver could ever need. We shall never darken the corridors of Tesco again.

## Saturday

### First we eat, drive and change

I rose early and almost collided with Nuria and Arianna coming up the stairs - they had decided to launch a joint expedition to the loo. A classic caving breakfast ensued, but it turned out we'd forgotten to buy any baked beans! Fortunately, Jarv found a box with some of his old food in, and as the beans were less than two years out of date we went for them. Delicious.

We were waiting for Will to arrive at Clapham on the train, so I briefly demonstrated a deviation to our new cavers, followed by my Drill Sergeant impression as they practised hard locking. We grabbed a bedraggled looking Will, who defensively told us he'd only vomited once this morning (*), and set off to Leck Fell.

Gosh, it is a godawful place. The sleet came across the fell at Mach 3, completely horizontal. We swung the minibus round to present a broadside to the wind, causing it to rock alarmingly as we desperately changed. Around an hour later, we screamed at each other about tackle sacks until it was time to enter the cave.



#### Jack

(*) I got the full story on the tube on Sunday night. He'd vomited only once, for sure, but in his old bedroom at his family home, all over the bed and onto the carpet. Since he had to leave to catch the dawn train, he left it uncleaned and emailed his parents, who were leaving themselves that day on holiday, to prewarn them. Truly a caving god amongst us mere mortals.

Okay, enough about vomit.

#### Jarv

### Lost Johns'

We were in three groups - Oli would rig Dome down to the bottom of Monastery, Jarv would follow and rig down Dome Junction, and I would rig down Centipede to meet them. We optimistically had the ropes for Valhalla and Final (I quickly gifted them to Peter in Jarv's group). We'd already abandoned Monastery due to the torrential rain, and in the streamway, we saw we were right. There was a raging torrent that tipped every rock to its angle of repose, making walking along an exercise in gently sliding with the mini underwater avalanches we triggered. Dave W stayed behind the first group to lure us up onto the dry traverse, and Ben quickly got to work rigging Hammer, the first pitch in the Centipede series.

My group consisted of three SRT novices (one of whom hadn't been in a cave before!) so they seemed excited and a little nervous. I skipped past them down the rope so I could rig Mud and Centipede, and realised how much I enjoyed Lost Johns' for about the umpteenth time. It really is a beautiful and varied cave, with lots of little surprises and quirks. I decided to show off to Isha by descending down Centipede at a rapid rate, but I had forgotten how long the pitch was. Suddenly I was plummeting into the darkness with no sign of the bottom, so I slowed my self down, looked around and took the rest at a more leisurely pace - I wasn't convinced I'd tied a stopper knot...

At the bottom it was a long, cold wait for the rest of the team, but we were eventually all there, and buoyed by Dave's saturated solution of sugar free lemon squash and sugar, we pressed onwards, quickly reaching Candle and Shistol. At this point, Ben took over rigging, and Jarv caught up with our group from Dome, saying that someone had had a minor accident, but seemed unharmed and keen to continue. We dropped the first two rebelays on candle and Shistol, till it got stupidly wet. At this point I realised Ben had bravely/foolishly rigged down through the torrent. DW looked at me and said "I'm wearing fabric, I'm not going after him!" I concurred, and we shouted at Ben to come back up.

We were leaving just as Jarv's group caught us (apparently they got to the bottom of the pitch, through the water, but had left the bag for Battleaxe traverse behind. Schade). After getting an update on who was where, we headed out Dome. As I was derigging, a somewhat flustered Alex caught us up - he'd apparently been derigging the pitches down to the base of Monastery, and wanted to catch his group going out Centipede. I was sure I'd been told he was already out, so it's a good job he arrived when he did - otherwise we would have derigged all his escape routes...

It was slow going on the way out, but I was proud of the novices for handling the deviation and somewhat awkward pitch head on Dome so well. DW is an essential team member for this sort of trip - patient, calm and confident. He went ahead with Isha and Layla, with Ben going up next, followed by Edith and then myself derigging. I caught the group again in Cathedral, and Ben agreed to derig the rest so I swapped the order with him. No real mishaps here, apart from an interesting method for attached a hand jammer to a shock cord. I was singing Christmas carols when Edith and Ben joined in with the German lyrics (it's things like this that make Ben seem really foreign), and I rope walked as fast as possible up the pitch in the hope of impressing our novice. She seemed unfazed.

At the top we met up with Jarv's team heading over the top of us, and then after a short wait Ben caught up and we headed out together, meeting the front half of our group as we went. We returned last, changed in short order and drove back singing 'On the Surface Once Again'.

At the NPC, I cooked up a huge shakshuka with help from most of the club. It's a spicy tomato stew with eggs poached in it, very quick and extremely tasty.  
> ### Cavers' Shakshuka (serves 16)
> 
> - 8 red onions, sliced
> - 2 bulbs garlic, mashed
> - 8 bell peppers, sliced
> - 4 chilli peppers, sliced with seeds
> - 6 cans tomatoes
> - 1 tube tomato purée
> - Smoked paprika
> - Chilli powder
> - Cumin
>
> Fry the onions and garlic with salt, adding the chillis and bell peppers when soft. Added chopped tomatoes and purée, simmer, adding spice to taste. Made an indentation in the stew, crack eggs into from some height so that they penetrate deeper into the stew. Cover and leave to simmer until egg white is cooked. Serve with crusty bread, cous cous and plain yoghurt.

"Take it easy." one said.  
"Find your maillon." another shouted.  
Look up at the steel Transit, leaden sky.  
"Underground there won't be any wind."  

"Can you pass a deviation? Prussic? Secure yourself?" I can pass a deviation sir, prussic an hour and secure myself back to. "If you see DANGER, pass the nylon webbing back to cover." I see danger sir.

And so we away, pull aside our white craft, left rocking and the buffet, scudding drifts across the desolate Leck fell. Heave to, heave to! We hear the roar approaching. Deep puddles, pierced Earth welling up it's water, and cascade down to where the wash roars and the white foam gasps with gappy teeth.

Slip underground and the warm moist breath envelops all. "Lights on now, everybody!" Click and flick and follow we go.

"Take it easy." one said, "The cobbles are still shifting from the floods." Easy sir, easy sir, I can crawl and scuttle, clamber and climb. Wet foot, wet foot, wet feet. 

"OK, away now - up into the roof traverse - the Cathedral is no place for cavers today." Dash and flash of white falls away, soft crystal walls, thud and percussive thud, not even sound, but below where sound can be.

"Rope now! Lock on, take care." I lock on, take care. Like an 'S' not a 'Z'. I soft lock, then hard lock. My lanyard? Good. Test a little, and away. Careful now! Keep control. And down.

And deviate. And crawl. And descend. Where to now? Over there. My view is dark! "Fiddle the switch." So to bright. More forms of rock and water and darkness. Echos back, the other group. "Hello there!" Exchange of people, plans and times. Too wet they say, too wet! "I've seen worse." a Ben.

Step through the window, halfway to a pitch, and down we see the worse. Beyond the white mush a light and "Just clip your cows-tails on. Take care, take care to climb! But drier this way." I take care, take care, but stream in face and icy tendrils slither down my chest. 

"OK, this last pitch, then that's us. Valhalla a maelstrom, and no more rope." Yes, that's us, that's us. Last slither and crawl, we. Do not fall. Oh the white water dash and whistling airs.

Now away, and up and up. Step to step to step, and tired boredom. "Rope free you?" "No, sing me a song, sing me a caver song."

Icy airs and fog forms, plants suddenly lit by gentle LED. Icy gate and step quickly back to our white ship, hop from foot to foot, pass from underground to overground, wet socks to dry socks.

## Sunday

### Executive summary

"I went into lost Johns, it was quite wet, but not too wet thankfully, on Sunday I went to notts 2, the scaffolding was fun"

#### Will

### Somewhat expanded report

Notts 2 is just a blast. You park right next to the entrance, stroll confidently over, flip the lid off and tell some terrified fresher to lead the way through an Esheresque nightmare of scaffolding, dodgy ladders, electrical wiring, breeze blocks, expanding foam and sodden boards. It's great fun to do the entrance series without using the ladders, especially on the way up. I followed up near the back, and was surprised to find that everyone made it to the dripping cavern just after the dodgy down climb.

We'd expected the streamway to be too flooded for us to enter, but the water was quite low, with only ominous clumps of foam hanging from the walls three metres up. I'm convinced they were from the flooding yesterday. We made good progress up the streamway, with various novices taking the lead, and I took a huge number of photos, some of which were almost good.

The pretties at the end were even better than I remember, including some superb straws and curtains (even a yellow striped curtain?!). On the way back, we moved quickly under Layla's guidance, arriving back to the minibus in time to whizz to the NPC for crumpets, fruitcake, mince pies and hosing the sheep shit off the tarpaulin.

What a glorious weekend.
