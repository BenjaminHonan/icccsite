## Friday

Another weekend, another quick swing by Leamington Spa to collect Alex, who'd be doing some of the driving. Having accidentally entered the train station during some brief rush hour, Jarv managed to escape by backing out onto a main road, before doing a U-turn to take us towards Morrisons. Despite Jarv's efforts to sabotage my thrifty food budget with knock off jaffa cakes, mince pies and double cream, the total came to around £5 a person, the best I've ever seen. We also discovered Biere Continentale, which at 2.8% makes even our standard Bier D'or look extravagant. Okay, enough about Morrisons.

Morrisons was amazing. The big yellow glow so near the train station, our promised land of cut price delights, shelves stacked with all a hungry caver could ever need. We shall never darken the corridors of Tesco again.

## Saturday

### First we eat, drive and change

I rose early and almost collided with Nuria and Arianna coming up the stairs - they had decided to launch a joint expedition to the loo. A classic caving breakfast ensued, but it turned out we'd forgotten to buy any baked beans! Fortunately, Jarv found a box with some of his old food in, and as the beans were less than two years out of date we went for them. Delicious.

We were waiting for Will to arrive at Clapham on the train, so I briefly demonstrated a deviation to our new cavers, followed by my Drill Sergeant impresson as they practiced hard locking. We grabbed a bedgraggled looking Will, who defensively told us he'd only vomitted once this morning (*), and set off to Leck Fell.

Gosh, it is a godawful place. The sleet came across the fell at Mach 3, completely horizontal. We swung the minibus round to present a broadside to the wind, causing it to rock alarmingly as we desperately changed.

#### Jack

(*) I got the full story on the tube on Sunday night. He'd vomitted only once, for sure, but in his old bedroom at his family home, all over the bed and onto the carpet. Since he had to leave to catch the dawn train, he left it uncleaned and emailed his parents, who were leaving themselves that day on holiday, to prewarn them. Truly a caving god amongst us mere mortals.

Okay, enough about vomit.

### Lost Johns'

"Take it easy." one said.  
"Find your maillon." another shouted.  
Look up at the steel Transit, leaden sky.  
"Underground there won't be any wind."  

"Can you pass a deviation? Prussic? Secure yourself?" I can pass a deviation sir, prussic an hour and secure myself back to. "If you see DANGER, pass the nylon webbing back to cover." I see danger sir.

And so we away, pull aside our white craft, left rocking and the buffet, scudding drifts across the desolate Leck fell. Heave to, heave to! We hear the roar approaching. Deep puddles, pierced Earth welling up it's water, and cascade down to where the wash roars and the white foam gasps with gappy teeth.

Slip underground and the warm moist breath envelops all. "Lights on now, everybody!" Click and flick and follow we go.

"Take it easy." one said, "The cobbles are still shifting from the floods." Easy sir, easy sir, I can crawl and scuttle, clamber and climb. Wet foot, wet foot, wet feet. 

"OK, away now - up into the roof traverse - the Cathedral is no place for cavers today." Dash and flash of white falls away, soft crystal walls, thud and percussive thud, not even sound, but below where sound can be.

"Rope now! Lock on, take care." I lock on, take care. Like an 'S' not a 'Z'. I soft lock, then hard lock. My lanyard? Good. Test a little, and away. Careful now! Keep control. And down.

And deviate. And crawl. And descend. Where to now? Over there. My view is dark! "Fiddle the switch." So to bright. More forms of rock and water and darkness. Echos back, the other group. "Hello there!" Exchange of people, plans and times. Too wet they say, too wet! "I've seen worse." a Ben.

Step through the window, halfway to a pitch, and down we see the worse. Beyond the white mush a light and "Just clip your cows-tails on. Take care, take care to climb! But drier this way." I take care, take care, but stream in face and icy tendrils slither down my chest. 

"OK, this last pitch, then that's us. Valhalla a maelstrom, and no more rope." Yes, that's us, that's us. Last slither and crawl, we. Do not fall. Oh the white water dash and whistling airs.

Now away, and up and up. Step to step to step, and tired boredom. "Rope free you?" "No, sing me a song, sing me a caver song."

Icy airs and fog forms, plants suddenly lit by gentle LED. Icy gate and step quickly back to our white ship, hop from foot to foot, pass from underground to overground, wet socks to dry socks.

## Sunday

## Executive summary

"I went into lost Johns, it was quite wet, but not too wet thankfully, on Sunday I went to notts 2, the scaffolding was fun"
