Title: Yorkshire 2
Date: 2016-11-25
Location: Yorkshire
Summary: Our second trip of the year, and in a break from tradition we stayed at the Bradford Pothole Club's hut in Brackenbottom, lovingly known as the Dump. We did the classic Flood/Bar exchange in Gaping Ghyll, with a splinter team to Little Hull, and on Sunday one trip went to Hunt pot, whilst the others tried to do a Sell Gill exchange.
