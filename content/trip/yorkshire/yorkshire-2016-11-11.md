Title: Yorkshire 1
Date: 2016-11-11
Location: Yorkshire
Summary: First SRT trip of the year. A break in the apparently ceaseless rain and snow up North allowed us a great tour of Kingsdale on Saturday, with gorups visiting Bull Pot, Jingling, and Aquamole. On Sunday those not broken by Saturday caving (and the evenings games) had a splash up Valley Entrance.
