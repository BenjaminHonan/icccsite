Title: Mendips I
Date: 2017-01-13
Location: Mendips
Summary: We return to the Mendips for our annual baptism in Sump 1. Two teams in Swildon's on Saturday, and one in Longwood Swallet. The SMCC has a fantastic new squeeze machine which we combined with a table to create our own speleolympics in the evening. Sunday saw a trip to GB and another Swildons round trip (as well as an expedition to a tea shop).
