Title: Mendips I
Date: 2016-01-22
Location: Mendips
Summary: The sun rises, the sun sets, and Imperial visit the Mendip Hills but once a year. This year we had four (count 'em) elite teams tackling various permutations on getting wet in Swildon's, and on Sunday one cracked team went back there, whilst the more sensible members of the club visiting Eastwater or GB.
