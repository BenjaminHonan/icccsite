First trip of the year, with all the new cavers! A smooth escape from London assisted by much stores-preparation during the week by the committee, a quick dally in the Swindon Tesco's hunting for Chilli ingredients, and then on to Brynmawr and the tram-road entrance to the CSS' hut Whitewalls on Llangattock.

##Saturday

Morning saw a stunningly beautiful view down into the verdant valley, whisps of cloud crawling up the brown-brackened Sugarloaf opposite. Breakfast gobbled & plans made, we changed in the rather pleasant changing room, and then turned out onto the tramroad, set ourselves into our three groups and headed off to Aggy.

##Sunday

### Aggy to Turkey pool: Jarv and Tanguy

Not too many people wanted to go caving on the Sunday, so Tanguy and I were free to have a little play in Aggy. After a rather curtailed trip yesterday, the idea of having a quick romp was very attractive. Tanguy had his camera and flash unit, and I had my little S95 - so we set off to take a few photos.

A big gang of Scouts quite literally screamed past Whitewalls as they headed to Egelwys Faen. Tanguy and I sauntered after them, catching up with them while they were having their safety briefing & one of the leaders was putting orienteering markers in place. 

We got to the Aggy entrance, and in typical 'experienced people doing a Sunday trip' fashion realised we weren't totally prepared - though we had a first aid kit, neither of us had a backup light! 
In at 12:20, we made some good time. I was soon massively overheating trying to keep up with Tanguy, with my over and under suit opened to the waist. At Baron's chamber, I asked for a few minutes respite, and lay flat out on a muddy boulder, to dump as much heat in as short time as possible! 

At the junction down from main chamber to the stream, I stashed my Sigg bottle after one last sip, and we zoomed off down-stream and up through the 2nd boulder choke. The crushed Ammo tin (old flood food dump) seeming to hold up the ceiling was pretty sobering! The high level route past the choke was pretty slippery, and it always feels a bit preposterous to head straight down to the big drop of the rift, only to step across and turn around to come back!

We were soon at Northwest Junction (1 hr after entering), after spotting a nice couple of pools below the Ochre inlet to consider photographing on the way back. Tanguy reported the plastic cup collecting the Ochre drink was half full of iron deposits when they came this way yesterday! Certainly the orange-yellow stain on the rock was slippery as anything here. Here, he fact that I did not have a backup light was underlined, by my incredibly reliable headlamp conking out when I tapped my helmet on the ceiling. Tanguy was well within hearing range, luckily! Just a dusty battery connection.

Upstream along Turkey, with a few glances at some of the calcite, and a bit of photography at the cascades. We found ourselves at Turkey Pool - certainly a nice bit! I think the (only) last time I came this way, I must have missed the Coal-Celler junction, and headed up unknowingly into Coal Cellar passage.  

Turkey Pool was beautiful. Really nice after all the mud to have some clean washed rock and pretty reflected lights on the ceiling. We took a couple of photos here, then assessed the situation. Tanguy promised many riches beyond, but also that the soaking was distinctly 'nipple deep'. We checked the time - nearly 14:00. To have a speedy return to London, we really had to be back at the hut by 16:00 ish. So we decided to turn at this point, and take a few more photos on the way out.

This we did, speeding along, without much need for discussion or digression. It's very strange doing a trip without novices to look after - I really felt like whole sections of my brain weren't needing to be engaged, a very relaxing trip, even if it was physically exercising.

Out to a beautiful valley, and then a quick hike back to the hut, just in time to gobble the proferred special-fried-rice and reheated crumble from last night.

Tanguy took the first shift on the minibus ride home. I wasn't too tired, but immobilised in the passenger seat by the many personal bags cluttered around, I kept on getting cramp in my legs, the effect of rather more boulder hopping than they were used to!
