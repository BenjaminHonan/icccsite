##Friday

Excellent minibus tunes - puff the magic dragon made several appearances 
Many bowls of cheesy pasta and beer before bed

##Saturday

Relatively late start, find I have no wellingtons or helmet...luckily my size was in the spare kit so didn't have to go bare foot or looking like a clown
Into the cave we go, straight away it was much tighter than I was expecting - lots of squeezing and crawling 
Definitely saw a bat at some point which was pretty cool
My helmet was too big (smallest size, guess my head is just tiny) so kept falling forward which made it hard to see as my light was never in the right place 
As soon as we hit water I got very heavy and much worse at climbing 
Some big Caverny bits - maybe 2? Where we lay down in the mud, also good photo op
Some pretty scary climbing at times but nobody died so that's fun 
Peeing in a cave is not on my recommend list tho
Also glasses are a bad idea if you're as clumsy as me, they're very scratched now, le cry
Overall good fun but pretty wet and muddy and gross
Many many bruises sustained, my whole left side from ankle to shoulder was covered
Oh I also had some pretty nasty blisters on my feet before going so that added pain and the slight worry of infection...luckily the cavers had some rather blackened tape stuff to cover them and all seemed fine

Had a good full English and selected teams - off we were to Aggy. This was the fifth time in a row Perry had been to Aggy doing the exact same trip. I had Peter, Luke, Yuchi and Tilly on my team. After waiting for the other teams to get ahead we entered the dusty bat ridden cavern. Left, left, left thatâ€™s all the navigation required for the entrance series, easy enough! The going was good, stopping here and there for a cheeky group pic and a snack.

##Sunday

Second day was much more chill although we did encounter a few too many spiders for my liking - the price to pay for going to a cave with lots of entrances and whatnot 
Also seemed to be a lot of army crawling which I am not a fan of
Much chocolate eating and photography occurred though so all in all a pretty good time
