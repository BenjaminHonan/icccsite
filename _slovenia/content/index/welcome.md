Imperial College Caving Club has run joint expeditions with <a href="http://www.pdtolmin.si">JSPDT</a> to the Julian alps in Western Slovenia most summers since 1994. The destination is Tolminski Migovec, a large undulating limestone plateau located about 6km North of the town of Tolmin within the Triglav national park.
Located midway between <i>Tolminski Kuk</i> and <i>Vogel</i> at approximately N 46 15' E 013 45' (<a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;q=46.25+13.75&amp;ll=46.249971,13.74999&amp;spn=0.028252,0.086517&amp;t=k&amp;om=1">Google Maps Satellite Data</a>), the large area offers enormous scope for further cave development.

Expedition base camp is located at 1880m above sea level on the western edge of the plateau, with the <a href="/caving/photo_archive/slovenia/1996/bivi%20in%20the%20summer%201996%20by%20mark%20evans.html">Bivvi</a> situated in a large shakehole benefiting from the shelter of a [distinctly unstable looking] rock bridge.

On this site you'll find our annual reports, large amounts of photos from each expedition, links to our raw survey data on github, drawn plans and extended elevations of the cave.
