Title: Yorkshire
Date: 2008-12-05
Location: yorkshire
Summary: Too much snow to get to BPF, so dumped bus on the ice floe that was the NPC carpark.
King (to King Henry hall + back) & Tatham Wife on Sat - sledged down off the fell by the light of the moon on the 20cm of snow.
Sunday saw a Simpson Pot pull through to Valley Entrance, and a spot of Inglesport-bag sledging up Chapel-le-Dale.
