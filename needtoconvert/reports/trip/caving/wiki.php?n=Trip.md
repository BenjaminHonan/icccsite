Title: Yorkshire
Date: 
Location: caving
Summary: The threat of actually doing some serious caving was sufficent to put off the majority of ICCC cavers with complaints of course-work deadlines and relatives' birthdays. This left a hardened core to sweep up to the NPC and dive down King Pot in sodden conditions for a brilliant 10.5 hour trip to the bottom of the last pitch. Truly astounding cave!

##  Introduction 

![](mig.jpg) Imperial College Caving Club has run joint expeditions with [ JSPDT ](http://www.pdtolmin.si) to the Julian alps in Western Slovenia most summers since 1994. The destination is Tolminski Migovec, a large undulating limestone plateau located about 6km North of the town of Tolmin within the Triglav national park. Located midway between _ Tolminski Kuk _ and _ Vogel _ at approximately N 46 15' E 013 45' ( [ Google Maps Satellite Data ](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=46.25+13.75&ll=46.249971,13.74999&spn=0.028252,0.086517&t=k&om=1) ), the large area offers enormous scope for further cave development. 

Expedition base camp is located at 1880m above sea level on the western edge of the plateau, with the [ Bivvi ](/caving/photo_archive/slovenia/1996/bivi%20in%20the%20summer%201996%20by%20mark%20evans.html) situated in a large shakehole benefiting from the shelter of a [distinctly unstable looking] rock bridge.
