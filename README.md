Instructions are based on a linux set up but the semantic procedure (if not commands) should be the same.

#Basic set up

Install git! Get yourself a github account. Add yourself (by logging into the iccaving github account) or get someone to add you as a contributer to https://github.com/iccavingrepo/.
Then set up the repo on your computer.

    git clone https://github.com/iccavingrepo/icccsite

#Writing Trip Reports
First pull the repo so you're up to date. Navigate to the directory then:

    git pull

Then add your write your trip report as a markdown file (.md extenstion) to the content/ folder. If its a standard post or trip report stick it in the content/articles/ folder. Try to keep to the placename-yyyy-mm-dd.md filename format where possible.

##File layout
There is a template.md file in the root of the repo. Copy and paste this and fill it according to the instructions within. If in doubt have a look at an existing article.  

The key points are:
* There is a set of metadata at the top of each file. Make sure to fill this out
* Below the metadata, write your report
* Markdown syntax is simple and available online. Look it up, or look at another article to format yours. [Also check this](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/)
* HTML works fine in markdown files (the same as they would in an html file) so if you can't do something with markdown just stick the html in.

##Metadata
All trip reports can have the following metadata:

*Title*: Title of the trip, i.e Wales III or Yorkshire IV or France

*Date*: Date in YYYY-MM-DD format

*Location*: Location of trip i.e Yorkshire, Wales, or France. This is mostly used to autogenerate the photoarchive directory and can be left blank if it doesnt seem useful.

*Summary*: The short blurb that will appear on the main page.

*Type*: Usually either 'trip' or 'tour' depending on the trip report type. 'stickyindex' for the main calender item on the index page or 'index' for announcements.

*Photoarchive*: Delete for no photo archive, leave blank for autogenerated location, or type a custom path for the archive (/photo_archive/newzealand/YYYY-MM-DD%20-%20Placename). You will have to make this folder and populate it yourself.

*Mainimg*: filename including extension of image in photoarchive folder to display in the article, leave blank for no image.

*Thumbl*: filename including extension of image in photoarchive folder to display as the left thumbnail on the main index page

*Thumbr*: same but the right thumbnail

*Authors*: The authors of the article, seperated by commas e.g. "Stores Gnomes, Stores Mice"

*Cavepeeps*: A list of the trips that happened. Normal trips and through trips supported. Format as below:

    DATE=YYYY-MM-DD; CAVE=Cave 1; PEOPLE=Person 1, Person 2, Person 3, Person 4;
    DATE=YYYY-MM-DD; CAVE=Cave 2 > Cave 3; PEOPLE=Person 1, Person 2, Person 3, Person 4;

Each entry should be on a new line and lines after the first 1 should be indented by more than 4 spaces (essetially match up the start of the entries).

*Oldurl*: If this is an old trip report being converted copy the caving url from /rcc/ e.g /rcc/caving/place/YYYY-MM-DD-place.php and write it here. Otherwise delete this.

*Status*: Set this to "draft" if you don't want it to appear on the site yet or delete entirely/set to "published" if you do

##Special pages/posts

###Announcments/info posts
Announcments (or info posts or whatever) on the main page with the type 'index' can also have the following metadata:

*Link*: To set the a custom link from the announcmenet.

*Linktext*: What the link text should be.

These should be used to announce upcoming events or link to subsites etc. Anything that isn't really a trip or tour.

###Cave pages

The site generator generates a list of all the caves that are mentioned in the cavepeeps metadata of all the articles. It creates a page with a table listing all the trip reports mentioning that cave. It will also include an markdown/html blurb at the top if there is a markdown file in the caves/ directory with a filename matching the cavename. In that file the following metadata should be used:

*Country*: Country the cave is located in.

*Region*: The broad region, like Yorkshire or Andalucia.

*Subregion*: The valley, fell, town etc. where the cave is located. Like Leck Fell or Little Neath.

*System*: Cave system that the cave is part of. I've so far been using this as a "you might be able to do exchanges" type of signal. i.e easegill is seperate from the three counties system despite being connected underwater.

Below the metadata you can write whatever you want in markdown/html and it will appear at the top of the cave's page, above the trip listings.

###People pages
Similar to the cave pages. There is no specific metadata here so write what you want.

###In page tags
There are a couple of tags/markdown shortcuts you can place in any article in addition to the standard markdown syntax.

If you have defined a mainimg in your article metadata then to position the mainimg in the page use:

    {{ mainimg }}

This will be replaced by all the lovely html for the image.

If you have defined a cave, date and people in cavepeeps then to position a list of all cavers mentioned, with links to their pages, use:

    {{ allpeople }}

I've been using:

    #####{{ allpeople }}

Which becomes header 5 as there is no styling by default on the list (other than being links).

There is a plugin active to allow easy inline posting of images. Similar to the way links work in standard markdown:

    {"Caption Goes Here Or Not" left}("filename.jpg")

Within the curly braces on the left there is a caption in quotes, this is optional. There is also an alignment (left) on the right which can be left/right/center. In the round braces on the right is the url in quotes of the image. This will link to photos in the specified photoarchive (i.e just use the filename!).

If you want to link to images outside of the photoarchive then put an exclamation mark after the first curly brace:

    {!"Caption Goes Here Or Not" left}("www.external.com/image.jpg")

##Finishing
Save your .md file. Track the file in git:

    git add path/to/file

Commit your file(s):

    git commit -m "Put descriptive message here"

Please put in a good descirption of what you have done. E.g "Added a trip report for Yorkshire 3 15/03/15".  
Finally push your changes:

    git push

And that can be it. Contact whoever is in charge of the site to let them know to update it. If you want to see it yourself (good to check for formatting errors) then you can run the test script:

    sh test.sh

This will generate the site "locally". Change to the output directory and start the webserver of your choice. I suggest:

    python3 -m http.server

Navigate to 0.0.0.0:8000 with your web browser to see it. It is likely that images won't show up.

#Advanced Set Up
If you want to be able to build and deploy the site yourself look here, otherwise ignore.
###Installing Pelican
First make sure you have python 3. Python 2 will not work, it doesn't do unicode easily so I can't be bothered with it. If you like you can install virtualenv and then everything is set up in the env/ folder. You can then also use the publish.sh script. Otherwise:

Pelican is a python based static site generator. Install it:

    pip install pelican

Install the Markdown package as that is what the trip reports should be written in:

    pip install Markdown

Install BeautifulSoup:

    pip install beautifulsoup4

Firstly run:

    pelican content -s publishconf.py

This will build the site and output it to the output folder. To push the site to the union server (and therefore make it live) you will need at least sftp access (can be requested via a sysadmin form). You need to get the contents of the output folder into the /home/www/htdocs/rcc/caving/ folder. If you have ssh access (requested by emailing the sysadmin) then you can run:

    rsync -avz -e "ssh -p 10022" --chmod=ug+rwx,o-wx,o+r output/ username@dougal.union.ic.ac.uk:/home/www/htdocs/rcc/caving

##Photos
The photos are a bit more complicated. To do this you will need at least SFTP access.
* Make folder in appropriate location in photo_archive. e.g "/home/www/htdocs/rcc/caving/photo_archive/region/YYYY-MM-DD%20-%20Placename". Note: %20 is just a space character. Your sftp client can probably handle spaces.
* Upload photos to this folder.
* Run the thumb.sh script that is in photo_archive root from the directory with your new photos. This will generate the thumbnails and small images.
* Run the curator.sh script that is in photo_archive root from the directory with your new photos.
* In the relevant article, fill out the relevent metadata. (This can be done before making the folder/uploading photos, the links will just be dead until you do)
Done.

#Subsites
There is a plugin that allows subs sites to be added easily (like the NZ or Slov sites). They are treated essentially entirely seperate from the main site so you can have different plugins and completely different themes. Though its probably best just to modfiy the colour scheme slightly :P.
###Set up
It works like the main site. There is a content folder to put articles in, a plug in folder for site specific plugins, a themes folder for a site specific theme. The settings file is a little different. It has to be called "settings.py" and reside in the root of the subsite.

In "settings.py" there are two mandatory settings:

    PATH = 'content'

This should point to the folder that your markdown files are in.

    SUBSITE_PATH = 'newzealand'

This should be the name of the subdirectory you want the site to reside in once its published.

All other settings are optional and will default to the main site's settings. All of the file paths in this settings file will be relative to the file itself (i.e not the main site root). Useful settings to change might be the THEME, PLUGINS, PLUGIN_PATHS or STATIC_PATHS which will copy directories in the subsites content folder into the subsites output (just like for the main site).
