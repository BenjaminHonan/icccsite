METADATA:

Title: Title of the trip, i.e Wales III or Yorkshire IV or France

Date: Date in YYYY-MM-DD format

Location: Location of trip i.e Yorkshire, Wales, or France

Summary: The short blurb that will appear on the main page

Photoarchive: Delete for no photo archive, leave blank for autogenerated location (will not work for NZ subsite), or type a custom path for the archive (../photo_archive/newzealand/YYYY-MM-DD%20-%20Placename). You will have to make this folder and populate it yourself.

Mainimg: filename including extension of image in photoarchive folder to display in the article, leave blank for no image.

Thumbl: filename including extension of image in photoarchive folder to display as the left thumbnail on the main index page

Thumbr: same but the right thumbnail

Author: The authors of the article, seperated by commas e.g. "Stores Gnomes, Stores Mice"

Status: Set this to "draft" if you don't want it to appear on the site yet or delete entirely if you do

OTHER STUFF:

There is a plugin active to allow easy inline posting of images. Similar to the way links work in standard markdown:
{"Caption Goes Here Or Not" left}("filename.jpg")
Within the curly braces on the left there is a caption in quotes, this is optional. There is also an alignment (left) on the right which can be left/right/center. In the round braces on the right is the url in quotes of the image. This will link to photos in the specified photoarchive (i.e just use the filename!).
If you want to link to images outside of the photoarchive then put an exclamation mark after the first curly brace:
{!"Caption Goes Here Or Not" left}("www.external.com/image.jpg")
